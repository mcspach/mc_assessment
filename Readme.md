##Task 1
- Created a responsive design based on provided screenshot. 
  - Tools:
  HTML
  SCSS
  Lightbox
  Bootstrap
-Passed accessibility checks from aChecker, Wave, and W3C - screenshots included in folder

##Task 2
- Used HTML/SCSS/JS to create the news feed from the given RSS feed.
- Notes: 
  - The initial coding was quite easy, parsing the rss and creating the html elements. 
  - More time-consuming peices included adding a placeholder image for the articles with broken image links. The solution I went with for this is not my favorite, but does the trick. 
  - Struggled a bit with Promises and error-handling as that is not one of my strongsuits, but ended up with a solution I like that meets all the requirements.

##Task 3
- Made the appropriate API calls to decipher the heading text, then retreived the faculty data and rendered to a table. The table is sortable using the 'Sorttable' library, and built out a searchbar and buttons that filter the table. 
- Tools:
  - HTML/SCSS
  - JS
  - SortTable API
  - a little bootstrap

##Task 4
- Since this task was described as optional, I decided to pick one of the challenges rather than completing both. I chose the second challenge because I felt confident I could find a solution, whereas the binary tree travesal is not something I have experience with. 
- Although this took a bit of trial and error, I found a reasonable solution in about an hour. I got stuck with 5/6 tests passing, which ended up being an issue in the final value I was retuning.
